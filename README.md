Predicting the 2023 NBA Champion using Data Science

Collaborators: Ayman Chowdhury, Keshav Ganapathy, Julian Javillo, Sahit Kadthala

Introduction

The analysis of this project was formulated with the intention of exploring the key steps involved in data science. Towards this end, we have taken it upon ourselves to investigate how an NBA team's common regular season metrics such as its average points per game, avergae rebounds per game, average field goal percentage, and so forth over the course of the year influence its probability at winning a championship.

For more context, the NBA stands for the National Basketball Association and is a basketball league that has featured the premier basketball players in the world since its inception roughly 75 years ago. Every single season takes place from around the start of November to the start of June and includes a tournament at the end called the playoffs whose winner is deemed the "champion." Each one can be split into two chunks -- one chunk prior to the playoff tournament (called the regular season) and the other being the playoff tournament itself. Roughly the top half of NBA teams in terms of win-to-loss ratio (also known as win-loss record) make it to the playoffs, with each team paired with another and the winner of the match-up moving on to the next stage. As such, we wish to see how teams' regular season metrics can be used to predict who the nba champion will end up being. Read this article if interested in more details of how the playoffs work.

The reason we focus on the NBA is multi-fold. For one, due to the nature of how basketball is played and the meticulousness of the NBA's statkeeping, there is plenty of data that exists with regard to NBA teams' regular season performance. This means that there is plenty of data that we can use to analyze and that we can utilize to showcase the essence of data science. A quick note that should be made is that other metrics exist besides a team's points per game, rebounds per game, and so forth in the form of "advanced stats," but we want to focus on more general ones since those tend to be the ones looked upon by the common fan. Another reason is the sheer relevance and importance of the NBA and its playoffs as well as what it means for millions. Right now, the NBA playoffs are taking place, so the topic is fresh in the minds of many. Just to get an idea of how much of a cultural phenomenon the NBA and its playoffs are, according to Front Office Sports, the NBA made over 10 billion dollars in revenue (see this article for more details) and is commonly referenced in many popular shows and music songs of the day. The NBA brings a myriad of people together, hoping for their teams to get their hands on the grand prize of a championship, which gives a sense of how meaningful the topic of who will end up winning will be.

With that being said, we shall commence with our tutorial of the data science process. The steps go as follows:

1.) Data Collection
2.) Data Processing
3.) Exploratory Analysis and Visualization
4.) Machine Learning Modeling
5.) Insight and Conclusions
